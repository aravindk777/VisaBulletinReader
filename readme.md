# Visa Bulletin Reader
This is a simple web scraper to get the latest visa bulletin information from the [travel.state.gov](https://travel.state.gov/) website. I started this with a goal of learning python and web scrapping capabilities. Apparently, created a web app to display the information in a more user-friendly and intuitive way. 

## Features and Goals
